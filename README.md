## Professional Summary

As a software engineer with a solid foundation from Pondicherry University, I specialize in Python programming, focusing on Django for PLM/ERP systems. My 6-year career has been dedicated to developing Python-based solutions, including relational databases and electronic projects, and deploying and managing high-capacity Linux servers (up to 256GB RAM, 80 CPUs) in cloud environments like AWS. My Python skills have been crucial in creating scalable, efficient applications for business, chatbots, and enterprise software. Additionally, I possess intermediate skills in front-end development with JavaScript and React, enabling me to contribute to full-stack projects by integrating dynamic user interfaces with robust back-end systems, demonstrating my proficiency and commitment to using cutting-edge technologies to drive technological advancements.
